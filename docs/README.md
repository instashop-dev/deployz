# Deployz documentation

The documentation set for the Deployz MVP. Each area has one authoritative
document; other documents link to it instead of repeating it. The documents
describe the product **as implemented** and were verified against the code
on 2026-09-24; intended-but-unbuilt behavior is labelled as a gap or a
deferred item. Live operator settings (which Regions are enabled, whether
production billing is switched on) are held in GitHub repository variables,
not here.

| Question | Read |
| --- | --- |
| What is Deployz, what does the MVP do, what is out of scope? | [`product/mvp-scope.md`](product/mvp-scope.md) |
| What does a vendor do, what does a customer do, who configures what, who picks the Region? | [`product/user-flows.md`](product/user-flows.md) |
| How is it built, what runs in which AWS account, what does a deployment create? | [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) |
| How to work in this repository (layout, commands, CI) | [`../README.md`](../README.md) |
| Rules for coding agents | [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) |

## Conventions

- **Current vs intended.** When the implementation differs from the intended
  behavior, the document says so in place ("known gap") rather than
  describing the intent as fact. Code gaps are tracked in the pull request
  that found them, not in a standing document.
- **No implementation plans or run reports.** Completed plans, phase
  ledgers, audits and one-off canary reports are removed once their durable
  knowledge has moved into the documents above; git history keeps them.
  Exceptions are the benchmark finding registries under `testing/`, which
  the harnesses and tests read.
- **Names, never values.** Configuration keys are documented by name only.
- **Generated files.** `testing/*/runs/summary.md` files are written by the
  harness scripts; do not edit them by hand.
- **Language.** Instructions are written in Simplified Technical English
  (ASD-STE100): short sentences, one instruction each, active voice.
