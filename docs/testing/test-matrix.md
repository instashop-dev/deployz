# Deployz MVP test coverage matrix

## 1. Purpose

This matrix is the primary source of truth for Deployz MVP test coverage.
It lists every core capability. It shows the happy path, the failure
paths, the historical regressions, the intended test layers, the current
test coverage, and any missing coverage. Use it to answer two questions:
"is this capability tested?" and "at what layer?"

Update this matrix when you add a capability, close a coverage gap, or
change which layer owns a test. Do not let it go stale. It replaces ad
hoc searches across `e2e/`, `apps/api/src`, `apps/web/test`, and
`packages/*/test` as the way to check coverage before you ship a change.

## 2. How to read this matrix

Each row is one product capability, not one test file. A capability can
span several layers (for example, a unit test for the pure logic and an
E2E scenario for the wiring). The "Current coverage" column lists
concrete file paths, scenario IDs, or canary command names. Every file
path in this matrix exists in the repository at the time of writing. Every
scenario ID exists in `e2e/simulation/scenarios/index.ts`, or is named as
a spec-level `@scenario:` tag composed from a registered scenario (see
[`simulated-e2e.md`](simulated-e2e.md#scenario-selection)).

"Missing coverage" says what is not tested today. It does not say the
capability is broken. It says the matrix found no test for that failure
path or edge case. Section 3.4 turns every "Missing coverage" cell into a
proposed test, ordered by priority.

## 3. Layer legend

Layer definitions match [`strategy.md`](strategy.md#the-layers). Deployz
testing has seven layers, plus two categories that sit outside the layer
ladder.

- **L0 — static.** Build, lint, and typecheck (including the E2E harness
  and the AWS scripts), plus the static production-safety guards and the
  CDK bundling smoke. No running code. Runs on almost every pull request.
- **L1 — unit.** Pure logic with no external system: Vitest tests over
  fakes and in-memory fixtures. Runs on affected packages and their
  dependents.
- **L2 — integration/contract.** A real local dependency, but no network
  call to AWS or GitHub: PGlite-backed API/DB tests, CDK template synthesis,
  and parity tests that check one package's vocabulary against another's.
- **L3 — UI/workflow.** Playwright tests that drive the real web app and
  the real API. Fixture-mode specs replace GitHub, AI, and DNS with
  canned data. Scenario specs additionally replace the AWS SDK client with
  a `SimulatedCustomerAccount` and drive the real relay code over it.
- **L4 — AWS integration (`fresh`).** One real AWS boundary in minutes,
  with no product flow: create and destroy a bootstrap stack only.
- **L5 — AWS E2E (version canary).** A full real lifecycle through the
  deployed control plane, using a Deployz-controlled fixture application.
  Fixture A is the stateless profile (`profile --profile stateless`).
  Fixture B is the Postgres+Redis `core` ladder.
- **L6 — production canary.** The same L5 harness (`profile --profile
  stateless --production`) against the deployed control plane, on a
  schedule, to answer "can production Deployz deploy right now?"
- **compat** — the compatibility benchmark (Stage A `benchmark:compat`,
  offline; Stage B `benchmark:deploy`, real AWS against third-party repos).
  It measures analyser accuracy, not product regressions. It never runs on
  a pull request.
- **manual** — a human follows a written runbook. Today this is
  `docs/testing/manual-checklist.md`.

## 4. Priority legend

- **P0** — the core deployment path, or data safety (a bug here can
  strand or destroy a customer's AWS resources, or make the vendor and
  customer see different truths).
- **P1** — important MVP behaviour. A bug here degrades trust or wastes
  operator time, but does not strand resources or corrupt state.
- **P2** — polish. A bug here is cosmetic, or affects a rarely used path.

| Storage detection | Analyser detects an S3/object-storage dependency | False-positive storage requirement | none named in the history mining | L1, L2 | `packages/contracts/src/aws-resources.test.ts`; `packages/analysis/test/stage-b-phase2.test.ts` (S3 binding derivation) | No application-level proof that a provisioned bucket is reachable end to end; `packages/fixture` has no S3 client, so neither the L5 canary nor any scenario exercises S3 at the application layer | P1 |
| Environment-variable discovery | Analyser lists required and optional env vars from source | Env var read through a helper/schema library is missed | 5 commits in the "Env vars" class, e.g. `2148e057` (directus shape), `b54481b5` (viper shape), `9ddd10e5` (module env object) | L1, compat | `packages/analysis/test/phase7.test.ts` (§11.2 env-var model, 43 tests); `packages/analysis/test/env-classification.test.ts` | COMP-017 (open): env reads through helper functions/schema libraries | P1 |
| Requirement validation | Preflight computes READY/ALMOST_READY/NOT_READY from the manifest | Manifest fails validation; preflight called before analysis finishes | `518ee409` (CANARY-004, generic retry message swallowed a real 422); `fa0b55d2` (red-team audit follow-ups) | L1, L2, L3 | `apps/api/src/preflight.test.ts`; `packages/analysis/test/readiness-report.test.ts`; `e2e/readiness.spec.ts`; `e2e/create-deployment.spec.ts` | none known | P0 |

| Reanalysis | Vendor re-triggers analysis; existing fix instructions are recomputed, not just kept | Re-analysis on an unchanged commit | `e2e/fix-instructions.spec.ts` header: "generating fix instructions never itself resolves the finding; re-analysis recomputes the same result" | L1, L3 | `apps/api/src/analysis.test.ts`; `e2e/fix-instructions.spec.ts` | none known | P2 |

## 8. Coverage gaps summary

This section lists every "Missing coverage" cell above as one proposed
fix. Each line names a proposed layer and a one-line proposed test. The
list is ordered by priority, P0 first.

### P0

1. **~~Vendor/customer deployment-status consistency.~~ Landed (server
   side).** `apps/api/src/deployment-status.test.ts` now cross-checks every
   shared field, not only `.stage`, across every scenario in the file's own
   matrix (see the capability row above).
   Proposed layer: L1 (done); L2/web (open).
   Remaining proposed test: one `apps/web` test that renders both the
   vendor detail view and the public-install/customer view from the same
   underlying status object and asserts they tell a consistent story.

2. **~~Simulated PURGE failure path.~~ Landed.** `e2e/simulation/relay-harness.ts`
   used to give PURGE an always-empty, always-succeeding orphan-ownership
   list; the `purge-failure` scenario
   (`e2e/simulation/scenarios/purge-failure.ts`, driven from
   `e2e/scenario-lifecycle.spec.ts`) now gives it one leftover resource and
   asserts the deployment surfaces it instead of reporting a clean purge
   (see the Retained resources row above). No further action needed.

3. **KMS real-SDK error-shape drift.** Every KMS test uses a hand-rolled
   fake `@aws-sdk/client-kms` client.
   Proposed layer: L2.
   Proposed test: add a targeted integration test that feeds
   `AccessDeniedException`, `DisabledException`, and `KeyUnavailableException`
   error shapes (matching the real SDK's error class names and fields)
   through `pending-secrets.ts`'s cipher creation path, asserting each
   fails closed with the correct diagnostic.

4. **S3 application-level binding proof.** No test proves a provisioned
   bucket is reachable from the running application.
   Proposed layer: L5 (Fixture B).
   Proposed test: add an S3 upload/download endpoint to `packages/fixture`.
   Exercise it from the version canary's storage-bearing profile so a real
   IAM/bucket regression is caught end to end, not only at CDK-synth level.

5. **Database detection false positives that provision real RDS.**
   `COMP-022` (open) and `DEPLOY-022`/`COMP-029` (open) describe a
   falsely-detected database provisioning a real, costly RDS instance in
   Stage B.
   Proposed layer: compat (Stage A) plus L1.
   Proposed test: add the specific repo shape from `DEPLOY-022`/`COMP-029`
   to the Stage A corpus as a regression fixture, and add a
   `packages/analysis` unit case asserting an env-gated DB engine choice
   is not rated READY without the value present (closes `COMP-022`
   directly).

6. **Watchdog/reconciliation stays L1-only by design.** This is a
   deliberate architecture decision, not an oversight — recorded here so
   it is not mistaken for an accidental gap. No action needed unless the
   decision changes.

### P1

7. **`/retry-install` admin route depth.** Only the pure
   `retryEligibilityFor` unit and `admin-actions.test.ts`'s narrow cases
   exist.
   Proposed layer: L2.
   Proposed test: add route-level cases to
   `apps/api/src/admin/admin-actions.test.ts` covering the full retry
   eligibility matrix (not-yet-failed, already-retrying, blocked by a
   `DELETE_FAILED` stack, exhausted retries).

8. **Region-asset mismatch has no simulated-E2E analog.** This is an
   accepted architecture decision (no CFN-timeline analog exists), but the
   real-AWS layer that does cover it (`fresh`) only runs on demand.
   Proposed layer: L4.
   Proposed test: add a `--region` option to `pnpm e2e:fresh` so an
   operator can target a non-default region after a bootstrap/Lambda-asset
   change, and run it as a periodic (not per-PR) check.

9. **HTTPS-ACTIVE explicit assertion missing from the base version
   canary.** Stage B has this; `core`/`resilience`/`profile` do not.
   Proposed layer: L5.
   Proposed test: port Stage B's `describeDependencies` HTTPS-ACTIVE wait
   into `scripts/version-canary/steps.ts`, reused by `core`/`resilience`/
   `profile`.

10. **CFN failed-event capture is missing from all real-AWS harnesses.**
    Proposed layer: L5.
    Proposed test: add a `DescribeStackEvents` capture (filtered to
    `*_FAILED`) into `scripts/version-canary/evidence.ts`'s step details,
    triggered only on a failing step, reused automatically by Stage B.

11. **No account-wide, cross-region, run-ID-independent orphan sweep.**
    Proposed layer: L6 / new scheduled tooling.
    Proposed test/tool: a scheduled job that cross-references every
    Deployz-tagged resource against the DB's live deployments and
    installations, across all supported regions, report-only.

12. **`customer-reset` has no AWS account-id guard.**
    Proposed layer: tooling (unit-testable).
    Proposed test: add an `identity.account === EXPECTED` assertion at
    the top of `runCleanup`/`runInventory` in
    `scripts/customer-reset/index.ts`, matching the pattern in
    `scripts/version-canary/config.ts`'s `requireRealAwsOptIn`, with a
    unit test asserting it refuses a foreign account.

13. **`customer-reset` has no structured per-run evidence.**
    Proposed layer: tooling.
    Proposed test: add a minimal per-run JSON log (attempted/succeeded/
    failed per deployment), modelled on `scripts/version-canary/evidence.ts`'s
    `Evidence` class.

14. **Build pipeline (CodeBuild) has no L2/L3 coverage.** This is
    intentional (`BUILD_FIXTURE_MODE` bypasses it), but leaves a layer gap
    between unit tests and the real-AWS canary.
    Proposed layer: L2.
    Proposed test: add a `packages/cdk/test/worker.test.ts` case that
    simulates a CodeBuild-reported failure event flowing through job
    status derivation, distinct from the already-covered pure
    classification unit tests.

15. **~~23 "Targeted-only" Playwright specs never run automatically on
    push/critical/targeted-web.~~ Resolved.** The CI classifier redesign
    (see [`ci.md`](ci.md)) replaced the old exact-spec-file mapping with
    a fixture-mode Playwright suite (`node scripts/e2e.mjs --grep-invert
    "@scenario|visual"`) that runs every non-scenario, non-visual spec for
    any targeted change to runtime UI/API code, and the full suite for
    every critical pull request and every push to `main`. No further
    action needed.

16. **~~`e2e.yml` (the only automated runner of those 23 specs) has no
    schedule trigger.~~ Resolved.** `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`
    (`workflow_dispatch` only) is deleted: the fixture-mode and full
    Playwright suites now run through `ci.yml` on every push to `main` and
    on `ci.yml`'s own `workflow_dispatch`, which needs no separate schedule.

17. **Redis and S3 are proven only at the provisioning level, never at
    the application level.**
    Proposed layer: L5 (Fixture B, deferred).
    Proposed test: when Fixture B is built, add a cache read/write
    endpoint alongside the S3 endpoint from item 4, exercised by the
    `redis` canary profile.

### P2

18. **GitHub App access revoked mid-session.**
    Proposed layer: L1.
    Proposed test: add a case to `apps/api/src/github.test.ts` where the
    installation's selected-repo list changes between analysis start and
    analysis completion, asserting a clear failure instead of a silent
    success on stale access.

19. **Commit-selection server-side validation.**
    Proposed layer: L1/L2.
    Proposed test: add a case (to `apps/api/src/analysis.test.ts` or a
    new small file) asserting an invalid or unreachable commit SHA is
    rejected before a release is created.

20. **`docs/ui-system.md` documented a non-existent `pnpm test:e2e`
    script for `visual.spec.ts`.**
    Status: **fixed** in this pass — corrected to `pnpm e2e
    e2e/visual.spec.ts`, with a note that the snapshots are Windows-only.

21. **~~`jev-eval`/`jev-shadow` is orphaned tooling~~ Resolved.** `pnpm
    jev:eval` is now documented in [`compatibility.md`](compatibility.md)
    and its run evidence moved from `docs/testing/jev-shadow/runs/` to
    `scripts/jev-eval/runs/` (kept, not a test-coverage gap).

22. **~~Stage B B1 `runtime-reuse` class is dead code.~~ Resolved.** The
    `--runtime-reuse` CLI path and `assertRuntimeReuseSupported()` are
    removed from `scripts/repository-deployment`; `DEPLOY-017` stays the
    historical record. See [`compatibility.md`](compatibility.md).

Keep this matrix current:

- When you add a capability, add one row to the matching section.
- When you close a "Missing coverage" cell, update that cell and remove
  the matching item from Section 8, or mark it done.
- When a test file is renamed, moved, or deleted, update every row that
  cites it.
- Do not let this file describe a test, scenario, or command that no
  longer exists. If you are unsure whether a citation is still accurate,
  verify it before you trust it.
