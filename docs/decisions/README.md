# Decision log

Architecture and product decisions whose reasoning is still worth knowing.
Each entry states the decision, why, and what would change it. Completed
implementation plans and one-off reports are not kept; git history has them.
Three decisions with substantial detail have their own files:
[`deploy-gate.md`](deploy-gate.md),
[`failed-install-recovery.md`](failed-install-recovery.md) and
[`pending-command-authority.md`](pending-command-authority.md).

## AI explanations are on-demand and never change state (2026-08-25)

A deployment diagnosis or a build-failure explanation is generated only when
a user asks, cached on the job or release row, and claimed with a
single-flight `UPDATE … WHERE state IN ('PENDING','FAILED') OR (state =
'GENERATING' AND claimed_at < now() - interval '5 minutes')` so two requests
never pay for two model calls. The pattern works identically on Postgres and
PGlite, which advisory locks do not. AI output is advisory copy; it never
sets deployment state, failure codes or retry eligibility. The gateway is
Cloudflare AI Gateway (`AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL`, `AI_PROVIDER_API_KEY`, optional
`AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN` only for an authenticated gateway, `AI_MODEL`); with no
configuration the deterministic copy is served instead of an error. See
[`../ai-analysis.md`](../ai-analysis.md).

## Installation is verified from CloudFormation, inside the relay (2026-08-26)

A production install once reported success against an empty account. Since
then the relay's `verifyInstallation` reads the application stack
(exists, complete, carries the installation tag, and contains the components
the deployment's infrastructure profile requires) before an INSTALL, deploy
or rollback result counts, and the heartbeat reports the same checks.
Rejected: sweeping the account for resources (needs IAM the relay must not
have, mostly untaggable); verifying from the control plane (needs
cross-account credentials, which the trust model forbids); a new
`INSTALL_UNVERIFIED` failure code (the failure-code enum is mirrored in the
database and copy map; `STACK_CREATE_FAILED` already means "the stack is not
there"). Later hardening replaced the CloudFormation-only deploy gate with
the runtime promotion gates in
[`../deployment-resilience.md`](../deployment-resilience.md).

## Alphanumeric database passwords, secret-backed `DATABASE_URL` (2026-08-27)

The task's `DATABASE_URL` is assembled through a CloudFormation dynamic
reference to a Secrets Manager secret, and dynamic references are not
percent-encoded. A generated password containing a URL-reserved character
corrupts the URL and the install rolls back minutes in (seen live). The
generated password therefore excludes punctuation entirely. The same work
made the container contract (port, health path, task size, grace period,
secret parameters) overridable per application preset; the Documenso preset
also proved that an application which derives its cookie domain from a
public URL needs a non-empty URL from the first boot, so a domain-less
install falls back to the ALB's own URL.

## Valkey: single-node replication group, TLS off (2026-08-30)

ElastiCache's `CreateCacheCluster` rejects the Valkey engine, so the cache is
a `CfnReplicationGroup` with one node, no Multi-AZ and no automatic
failover. `transitEncryptionEnabled` is set to `false` explicitly because the
default enables TLS and breaks every `redis://` client; a repository that
requires `rediss://`, Redis Cluster or Redis Stack modules is rejected at
analysis instead. The relay's IAM must authorize the replication-group
actions against the default parameter group as well as the tagged resource,
or a denied create leaves an untagged group behind and the stack cannot roll
back.

## Background workers are deferred — Option B (2026-09-02)

A repository that declares a worker process is rated needs-adaptation, and
the worker-command configuration surface is disabled. Real worker support
(Option A) would need a per-application infrastructure model (the shared
published templates cannot bake a per-app worker command) and dual-service
semantics across every relay module that today takes the first
`AWS::ECS::Service`. The CDK construct still contains a worker branch; no
published template enables it. In-process schedulers inside the web
container are allowed.

**Superseded 2026-09-28.** Phase 4 of the dynamic-infrastructure plan
shipped the workload model, which delivers Option A's outcome without the
rejected mechanics: there are no shared templates left to bake a command
into (compiler-v2 composes from the graph), so a declared worker process
becomes its own ECS service with its own frozen command. What stays
out: worker-like code with no declared start command becomes a
needs-input question and is never provisioned from weak evidence. See the
2026-09-28 boundary decision below.

## Disconnect retains data; no final snapshot (2026-09-02)

The application template sets `DeletionPolicy: Retain` on the RDS instance,
its subnet group, its credential secrets and the S3 bucket. Disconnect
(DESTROY) deletes the running application and network and leaves those
behind, with RDS automated backups continuing; Purge deletes them directly
with `SkipFinalSnapshot: true`. The earlier "final snapshot on delete" claim
was never implemented and was removed rather than built: a snapshot would
add a second retained artefact class to track, purge and bill, without
adding safety over the retained instance itself. The bootstrap stack is
never deleted by the relay (it cannot delete its own role); the customer
deletes it.

Resolved with the compiler-v2 cutover (2026-09-26): a DESTROY that retains
data is a **success**. The deletion-protected database fails its delete
after the security group and subnet it pins, so the stack passes through
`DELETE_FAILED`; the relay re-issues the delete with `RetainResources` for
the failed resources, repeating the pass until the stack reaches
`DELETE_COMPLETE`, and the deployment settles `DELETED` — the retained
data is deliberate, visible and purgeable, not a failure. PURGE then
removes the retained data, including every owned application secret
regardless of infrastructure generation (see the 2026-09-26 record
below).

## The stored manifest is the only source of infrastructure intent (2026-09-02, reaffirmed 2026-09-17)

The analyzer writes a versioned `DeploymentManifest`; it is frozen on the
deployment at creation, and every consumer (template selection, the INSTALL
payload, relay verification, deployment plans, the resource inventory) reads
it rather than the live `applications` columns. Invalid or missing
requirements fail before provisioning; nothing defaults to PostgreSQL. An
existing deployment's topology never changes: a requirement change is
reported as drift and satisfied by a new deployment.

## Default HTTPS uses a Deployz-owned hostname per deployment (2026-09-03)

ACM certificates are Region- and account-bound and cannot be exported, so a
shared Deployz certificate cannot terminate TLS on a customer's ALB.
Option A: a per-deployment certificate requested in the customer account,
DNS-validated through a record the control plane writes into its own zone,
reusing the existing `CONFIGURE_DOMAIN` / `REMOVE_DOMAIN` relay vocabulary
unchanged. Option B (a CloudFront distribution in the Deployz account) was
rejected because it adds a cross-account resource lifecycle that the
customer-account teardown machinery cannot reach, and a second TLS hop. The
zone moved from Route 53 to Cloudflare the next day because `deployz.dev`
lives on Cloudflare; the trade-off is that default-URL traffic transits the
Cloudflare edge. See [`../networking-and-https.md`](../networking-and-https.md).

## Infrastructure profiles are immutable and frozen per deployment (2026-09-03, registry 2026-09-22)

Sizing lives in an immutable registry (`small-v1` today) and is frozen into
`desired_state.infrastructureProfile` at creation. A new size is a new
registry version plus republished templates; `small-v1` is never edited. A
topology-changing `minimal` profile (no NAT, fewer AZs) needs a new
infrastructure version and a security and cost review, not a registry row.
See [`../infrastructure-profiles.md`](../infrastructure-profiles.md).

## Jev shadow analysis is not adopted (2026-09-20)

A shadow-mode second opinion from the Jev model agreed with the deterministic
analyzer on all 360 labelled decisions across 120 repositories, produced no
discriminative signal, and misclassified every verifiable failure case, most
with high confidence. The code stays behind `JEV_ENABLED` (unset in
production; the deploy workflow never sets the `JEV_*` keys) with zero
runtime effect, and `pnpm jev:eval` remains a one-command re-evaluation if a
future model version warrants it (its evidence lives under
`scripts/jev-eval/runs/`, generated). Nothing routes a production
decision through Jev.

## Config secrets are KMS-encrypted; Lambdas fail closed (2026-09-22)

Vendor and customer secret values and pre-relay pending secrets are
encrypted with a dedicated KMS key (`alias/deployz-config-secrets`,
`RemovalPolicy.RETAIN`) using a fixed encryption-context purpose plus an
allowlisted context, enforced by IAM conditions. Inside Lambda a missing or
malformed key ARN fails initialization instead of falling back to a
reversible stub; outside Lambda the stub exists only for local development.
The worker may only decrypt. Legacy stub rows were migrated once and the
migration module removed; a rollback to pre-migration code would lose access
to stored secrets, so fixes go forward. See
[`../pending-secret-delivery.md`](../pending-secret-delivery.md).

## Raw CloudFormation events reach the customer page only behind a disclosure (2026-09-24)

The customer install page's live-activity feed keeps every customer-visible
field jargon-free (the stage headline, the step labels, the activity
messages, the friendly failure message), and puts the raw CloudFormation
events — including a failed resource's status reason — behind the collapsed
"View raw AWS events" disclosure and the technical-details facts. A
customer who opens the disclosure sees exactly what AWS reported; a
customer who does not never sees the jargon. `apps/api/src/customer-activity.test.ts`
pins both halves, and the E2E failure-path test asserts the raw reason is
hidden on the page, not absent from its payload.

## Runtime-v1 backward compatibility is not required for the MVP (2026-09-25, executed 2026-09-26)

Deployz is pre-launch. There are no live customer deployments on the
runtime-v1 template generation, so the MVP does not preserve
backward compatibility with it and does not build a migration path.

The four historical runtime-v1 template variants are reference
material, not compatibility contracts. Compiler-v2 became the sole
infrastructure-generation path for new deployments, as planned.
Internal test deployments may be recreated.

**Executed.** The relay now executes the frozen compiled artifact carried
in its INSTALL payload; the runtime-v1 machinery (template-variant
selection, the runtime-v1 application stack, the shadow-only integration,
v1↔v2 parity as a compatibility guarantee) is removed. The consequences
realized exactly as recorded: no migration layer was ever built, and no
dual runtime exists on any path.

What would change it: a contractual or operational requirement to
keep existing runtime-v1 deployments running after the MVP launches.

## Purge deletes every owned application secret regardless of generation (2026-09-26)

Purge's secret sweep keys on the `deployz:installation` tag, not on a
template-era allowlist: it deletes every tagged Secrets Manager secret the
relay owns **except** `deployz:component=bootstrap` — the relay's own
credential, which must survive so the relay can finish the purge. Earlier
purges only removed the compiler-v2 secret names; secrets left by any
other generation of the application stack would have survived purge
forever. Generation-agnostic deletion with the single bootstrap exclusion
is the invariant; the simulated `retained-delete-recovery` scenario and
the composite canary both assert a clean account after purge.

## Phase 3 passes without real-AWS validation (2026-09-27)

Phase 3 is an additive, spec-derived presentation cutover: existing
deployments render unchanged, lifecycle behavior is untouched, and the
simulated unit, contracts, web and E2E suites cover the behavior. The
phase gate therefore needs no AWS run. The Phase 2 carry-over
validations (`core` day-2 ladder completion; the `resilience` subcommand
plus RESTART-through-relay) and a full real-AWS lifecycle from a clean
account are deferred to the **Final AWS Qualification backlog**, to run
after the Phase 3 merge; the backlog is recorded in the
dynamic-infrastructure implementation plan. What would change it: any
further change that touches provisioning, lifecycle or the relay before
qualification has run.

## The MVP boundary expands to workers, RDS MySQL and migrations (2026-09-28)

Phase 4 moved three items from "rejected at analysis" into the supported
boundary: declared background worker processes, RDS MySQL, and
first-class one-shot migrations.

- **Workers** ride the workload model: one build artifact, one ECS
  service per workload, a frozen command per workload, stable kebab
  identities, no numbered fields. Only a declared run process provisions
  (a Procfile non-web entry, a Compose application service, an
  npm-script worker); weak evidence (queue libraries only) becomes a
  needs-input question, never an ECS service.
- **RDS MySQL** rides the same `relational_database` machinery as
  PostgreSQL: the resolver maps kind + engine to a capability, and
  networking, credentials, bindings, verification, retention and purge
  stay shared. The engine-specific part is one descriptor in the
  compiler. PostgreSQL manifests compile byte-identical output.
- **Migrations** are a one-shot workload with the frozen command baked
  into one named task definition. The relay runs only that family and
  can never receive a command string; the identity (sha256 over the
  frozen command plus the image digest) makes the run exactly-once per
  release. Failure stops the rollout, never the deployment — the
  deployment returns to `UPDATE_AVAILABLE` and the previous release
  keeps serving.

The one-build-artifact boundary is retained deliberately: multiple
build artifacts would multiply the release, build and rollback surface
for compositions the MVP target vendor does not have yet. A worker that
needs a different Dockerfile stays unsupported.

Private services were assessed and not implemented. The delivered
workload model (a workload kind plus `public: false` plus internal
networking) is expected to make them fall out naturally as a Phase 6
extension, not a rework.

Real-AWS qualification for the Phase 4 shapes is deferred: the evidence
is simulated E2E plus unit and contract tests, and the qualification
scenarios are recorded as pending in
[`../testing/aws-e2e.md`](../testing/aws-e2e.md).

What would change it: a vendor need for per-workload images (multiple
build artifacts), for services with no public exposure beyond workers,
or a failed real-AWS qualification of the recorded scenarios.

## The MVP boundary expands to SQS queues and scheduled jobs (2026-09-29)

Phase 5 moved two items from "rejected at analysis" or "not provisioned"
into the supported boundary: an SQS Standard queue (with an optional
dead-letter queue) and an EventBridge Scheduler schedule invoking a
one-shot scheduled ECS job.

- **Relationships are explicit graph edges, not inference.** A workload's
  use of a queue is a `produce` or `consume` edge; a queue's redrive
  target is a `dead-letter` edge; a schedule's target is an `invoke` edge.
  The planner validates the graph before any capability is resolved and
  fails closed: a queue with no producer or no consumer, a dead-letter
  queue that itself redrives, a schedule that does not invoke exactly one
  job, or a scheduled job invoked by more than one schedule all fail the
  plan rather than provisioning an orphan.
- **IAM is edge-derived and least-privilege, one role per workload.** Each
  non-web workload now gets its own IAM task role, built only from its own
  edges (`sqs:SendMessage` for a `produce` edge, the receive/delete/extend
  actions for a `consume` edge), so a producer never inherits a consumer's
  permissions and a worker never inherits another workload's queue access.
  This replaces the earlier single shared task role.
- **Detection requires strong evidence only.** A queue is provisioned only
  when its producer and consumer both resolve to a declared workload
  through bounded (depth-4) import reachability from that workload's own
  entry file, with no ambiguity. A scheduled job is provisioned only from
  an explicit production deployment declaration naming both a schedule and
  a command (a `render.yaml` `type: cron` service or a Kubernetes
  `CronJob` manifest) — never an in-process cron library, a CI-level
  schedule, a Vercel `crons` entry or a bare crontab file. Weak or
  ambiguous evidence always becomes a vendor question; Deployz never
  guesses and never provisions from it.
- **Only SQS Standard is supported, not FIFO.** FIFO's ordering and
  exactly-once semantics need application-level cooperation (message
  group IDs, deduplication) that Deployz does not verify. A FIFO queue
  request resolves to no capability and fails the plan rather than
  silently becoming Standard.
- **A dead-letter queue is the same SQS capability, not a separate
  resource kind.** It is an ordinary queue reached by a `dead-letter` edge
  from its source queue or schedule. For a queue, the compiler sets the
  source queue's `RedrivePolicy`; for a schedule, it sets the schedule
  target's `DeadLetterConfig` and grants the scheduler role
  `sqs:SendMessage` on that queue only.
- **A schedule targets its task family, not a pinned revision.** The
  compiler points the schedule at the revisionless task family ARN
  (`DeployzApp<Workload>`), the same family the relay registers each
  release's image into. A scheduled job therefore always runs the latest
  deployed image, mirroring how a service picks up a new release.
- **There is deliberately no execution-history subsystem for scheduled
  jobs.** Kept simple for the MVP; a job's outcome is visible only through
  the existing ECS task status and CloudWatch logs, the same as any other
  workload.
- **Both capabilities ship at `PREVIEW` maturity** until the real-AWS
  qualification recorded in [`../testing/aws-e2e.md`](../testing/aws-e2e.md)
  runs.
- **SQS usage in a repository is no longer an automatic rejection reason.**
  The earlier `sqs-event-consumer` rejection assumed any SQS consumer made
  the app an event-driven architecture Deployz could not host; Phase 5
  removes it, since a queue with a resolved producer and consumer is now a
  supported managed resource.

What would change it: the real-AWS qualification passing promotes SQS and
EventBridge Scheduler from `PREVIEW` to `SUPPORTED` maturity; a vendor need
for FIFO ordering or for scheduled-job execution history could revisit
those non-goals.

## Vendor runtime values reach running deployments (2026-10-02)

A saved or removed vendor runtime value now reaches every running
deployment of the application, the same way a customer override already
reaches that customer's deployment. Before, a vendor value reached only new
installations: a vendor who shipped a wrong value had no product path to
repair the customers already running it, because a deploy, a rollback and a
restart change only the image and never read configuration again.

- One `CONFIG_UPDATE` per customer with a connected relay; every message
  names its application, so a customer who runs two of the vendor's
  applications never receives one application's values or removals in the
  other.
- Vendor secret values never ride the queue. The relay decrypts them from
  its authenticated config read.
- A removed vendor default leaves a deployment only when that customer has
  no override for the key.
- Saving a decision (who provides a key) still starts no update.

What would change it: vendors who need staged rollouts of configuration
(one customer first) would need an explicit "apply to customers" step.

## The database spans all available AZs; the customer never picks one (2026-10-02)

RDS rejected installs with `InsufficientDBInstanceCapacity` because the
database subnet group only covered the two AZs that hold the private subnets.
The compute placement was correct and stayed correct; only the database had no
freedom to move. In a region where the requested instance class was exhausted
in those two AZs, the install could not succeed, and retrying it unchanged
could not succeed either.

- The relay discovers the region's available, enabled standard AZs through
  `DescribeAvailabilityZones` and passes them to the compiler as bounded
  `DbAz1`–`DbAz8` parameters. Fewer than two usable zones, or more than the
  eight slots, fails the attempt explicitly instead of silently narrowing.
- The compiler emits DB-only subnets for the slots beyond the two compute AZs.
  They are isolated — no NAT gateway, no internet route — and they exist only
  to give the subnet group somewhere else to go. The primary `/16` is fully
  allocated, so they live in a secondary VPC CIDR block.
- The DB instance's `AvailabilityZone` stays unset, so RDS picks one subnet
  from the group. The database remains **Single-AZ**, with its class, engine,
  storage, encryption, security, backups, deletion protection and retention
  unchanged.
- Placement is resolved only before a stack is created. An adopted or resumed
  stack keeps the placement it already has, and the extra subnets are owned,
  inventoried and purged with everything else.
- The failure now has its own code, `RDS_AZ_CAPACITY`, ahead of the generic
  database-create failure, so the customer reads "capacity unavailable, retry
  once the rollback finishes" instead of quota advice.

The database costs the same whether it lands in one AZ or another, but a
single-AZ database reached cross-AZ from the Fargate service can bill EC2
cross-AZ data transfer. That is shown as a usage-dependent charge, never as a
change to the estimated infrastructure total.

What would change it: a regional capacity crunch severe enough that a
Multi-AZ database or a different instance class is the only way through would
need a product decision, not a placement change — Multi-AZ roughly doubles the
database charge.

## A migration correction rides the migration seat (2026-10-02)

An existing deployment froze its migration command at creation. When that
command was wrong (for example an invented `npx …` the image could not
run), every release deployment failed `MIGRATION_FAILED`, and editing the
application changed only new deployments. The only repair was a new
deployment.

- The spec, the compiled artifact and the stack stay immutable. The
  application's migration setting and its vendor-override marker give the
  effective policy (frozen, corrected, or no separate migration), and each
  DEPLOY_RELEASE snapshots it when it is queued.
- The family-only payload contract gets one narrow amendment: the
  migration seat may carry the vendor's `command`. The relay accepts it
  only for a family that its deployment's own stack contains, puts it
  only into the application container of a new revision of that family
  (the compiler's command encoding), and runs that exact revision ARN.
  RunTask never carries a command override, and a top-level command is
  still dropped.
- A correction never adds a migration step to a deployment that was
  created without one; that needs a new deployment.
- Analysis stops adding `npx` without proof that the runtime image has
  the runner and the CLI. Uncertainty becomes a blocking vendor question.

Rejected: a RunTask command override (it bypasses the task definition the
relay can validate); recompiling the stack (it changes frozen
infrastructure); substituting `bunx` or installing tooling at run time
(Deployz would invent a command the vendor never ran).

Real-AWS qualification of the correction path is recorded as pending in
[`../testing/aws-e2e.md`](../testing/aws-e2e.md); the change deferred it
by instruction and did not waive it.

What would change it: a vendor need for per-deployment migration
commands, or relays that cannot be updated to read the seat's command.
