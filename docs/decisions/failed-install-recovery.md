# Failed first-install recovery (2026-08-27)

**Status:** active. Implemented in `packages/relay/src/recover.ts` and the
`POST /api/deployments/:id/retry-install` route; the vendor reaches it as
"Retry deployment" on the deployment detail page and Team Admin as a
recovery action. The lifecycle rules around it are in
[`../deployment-resilience.md`](../deployment-resilience.md).

## The problem

A failed **first** install used to brick a deployment permanently:

1. The relay honestly reports a terminal stack failure
   (`ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`, …) and never recreates such a stack.
2. CloudFormation cannot update a `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` stack, so every later
   INSTALL fails while it exists.
3. Deleting the stack by hand can also fail: the RDS instance is
   `Retain` **and** has deletion protection, and the S3 bucket is `Retain`.
   The retained instance keeps its security group's ENIs alive, the security
   group keeps the subnet and VPC alive, and the stack lands in
   `DELETE_FAILED`.
4. The INSTALL job was created only at relay registration, so there was no
   retry path at all.

## The decisions

1. **Recovery runs inside an explicit vendor retry; there is no separate
   "clean up first" action and no automatic recovery.** Deleting resources
   in a customer account always starts with a human decision. The retry is
   double-guarded: a control-plane flag in the job payload and a relay-side
   refusal to touch any stack that is healthy or in progress.
2. **"Never successfully installed" is asserted by the control plane.** The
   route refuses (`409 INSTALL_ALREADY_SUCCEEDED`) when any earlier INSTALL
   job succeeded. A deployment that was healthy once keeps its
   data-protection guarantees; its failures belong to deploy or rollback.
3. **Recovery uses only already-granted IAM.** The relay's provisioner
   policy already allows `rds:ModifyDBInstance`, `rds:DeleteDBInstance` and
   the ElastiCache replication-group deletion, all conditioned on the
   `deployz:installation` tag that the application stack applies. No new
   permissions, no bootstrap template change. Orphans are identified from
   the failed stack's own resource list, never by name guessing.
4. **The retained S3 bucket is deliberately left in place.** It blocks
   nothing, costs nothing when empty, and emptying it would need
   object-level `s3:DeleteObject*` grants that cannot stay inside the tag
   boundary (object ARNs do not resolve `aws:ResourceTag` conditions). A
   fresh install creates a new bucket. Empty retained credential secrets are
   also left behind; they hold no customer data.
5. **Bounded, convergent passes.** Every wait is capped inside the relay's
   5-minute invocation and the INSTALL executor's own budget. When the
   budget runs out the relay reports the real CloudFormation status; the
   vendor retries and each pass continues from real state. A stack already
   deleting is waited on, not re-deleted, until it settles `DELETE_FAILED`.
6. **Retryable states.** `FAILED`, and `INSTALLING` with an in-flight job
   older than 30 minutes (six missed relay polls: a dead invocation that
   would otherwise leave the deployment in `INSTALLING` forever; the stale
   job is cancelled and a fresh retry queued). Not retryable:
   `NOT_INSTALLED` (registration owns it), `INSTALLING` with a fresh attempt
   (a double-click replays the live job), `HEALTHY` / `UPDATE_AVAILABLE` /
   `UPDATING`, `DELETING` / `DELETED`. A relay that is not connected is
   refused with `409 RELAY_NOT_CONNECTED`; reconnect first.
7. **Attempt-scoped idempotency keys.** `${deploymentId}:INSTALL` is spent by
   the failed job, so retries use `${deploymentId}:INSTALL:RETRY:${n}`.
   Double-clicks on the same attempt still dedupe.
8. **Honest status is preserved.** Recovery is a separate module that runs
   before the unchanged install executor; the verification gate after
   install is unchanged.

## The flow

```
vendor: POST /api/deployments/:id/retry-install
  guards pass → new INSTALL job with { recovery: { neverInstalled: true } }
  deployment.state → INSTALLING, event install.retry.requested
relay (next poll):
  refuse live / in-progress stacks
  delete the terminal-failed stack, wait (bounded)
  on DELETE_FAILED: RDS deletion protection off → delete; delete the cache
  re-delete the stack, wait (bounded)
  installApplicationStack (unchanged) → verifyInstallation (unchanged)
```

A retried install that defers (stack still building) is finished by the
resumer on later polls without re-running recovery.
