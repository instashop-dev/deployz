# 100-repo MVP capability audit

Deployz `51997a3e` (main, 2026-10-06) · `ANALYSIS_VERSION` 38 · compiler `dynamic-compiler-v2-3`.
Sample: `repo-001`..`repo-100` from
[`testing/repository-compatibility/benchmark.yaml`](../testing/repository-compatibility/benchmark.yaml).
No AWS deployments. No product code changes.

## 1. Executive verdict

**Launch the MVP first. Fix Category C before launch. Do not start Phase 6 before launch.**

- Missing infrastructure is not the main blocker. MVP bugs are. 44 of the 66
  target-MVP repositories (67%) fit the current platform, but detection, gate or
  binding defects stop them.
- Today Deployz deploys 10 of 100 repositories meaningfully (A+B), and 5 of 66
  target repositories (8%). Do not launch in this state.
- Fixing Category C alone takes target-MVP coverage to 49 of 66 (74%), and all
  in-scope coverage to 54 of 89 (61%).
- The best single Phase 6 capability (6C EFS, or 6A/6B extra services) unlocks
  at most 6 target repositories (+9 points), at L complexity and high regression
  risk. The Category C fixes unlock 44 (+67 points) at S/M complexity.
- No repository needs Lambda, DynamoDB, OpenSearch (as a sole blocker) or
  CloudFront. No repository has detectable SQS or EventBridge Scheduler demand.
- The compiler is not a blocker. All 100 graphs compile. Every failure happens
  before the compiler: in analysis, the gate or the env bindings.

## 2. Current Deployz capability matrix

Code-verified at `51997a3e`. Code is the source of truth.

| Area | Current capability | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build | One Dockerfile from the repository is required. There is no buildpack, no build target and no build args. A `COPY .git` is rejected because builds use a GitHub tarball. | `packages/analysis/src/detectors.ts` `detectDockerfile`, `detectGitCopyInDockerfile` |
| Web | Exactly one public web workload behind the ALB. HTTPS on `d-<id>.deployz.dev` or a custom domain. Fargate `small-v1` gives 0.25 vCPU / 512 MiB, X86_64. | `packages/analysis/src/graph.ts:90`, `packages/contracts/src/profile.ts:40` |
| Workers | 0..N workers, each one ECS service. They use the same image with a different command, and come only from a Procfile, a compose worker or a package.json `worker` script. | `graph.ts:117`, `detectors.ts` `detectDeclaredWorkerCommands` |
| Migration | One one-shot task before rollout. It is used only when a deploy-safe command is found. A startup migration means no task. A missing migration is a warning only. | `graph.ts:142`, `apps/api/src/analysis.ts` `resolveMigrationCommand` |
| Scheduled jobs | EventBridge Scheduler to a one-shot ECS task. Sources are only `render.yaml` cron and Kubernetes `CronJob`. `PREVIEW`. | `packages/analysis/src/async-detection.ts:619` |
| Database | RDS PostgreSQL 16 or MySQL 8.0, one per deployment, retained on disconnect. MariaDB, MongoDB, SQLite, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, ClickHouse, Cassandra, Neo4j and H2 are rejected. | `packages/analysis/src/resolver.ts`, `rejection.ts` |
| Cache | ElastiCache Valkey, one node. No TLS, no AUTH, no cluster, no modules, `volatile-lru`. | `redis.ts`, `infrastructure-compiler/src/compile.ts` |
| Queue | SQS Standard plus an optional DLQ, only from JS/TS producer and consumer evidence. FIFO fails closed. `PREVIEW`. | `async-detection.ts:409`, `compile.ts:1158` |
| Object storage | One S3 bucket, always created, with task-role access. It is injected as `STORAGE_BUCKET`, `S3_BUCKET`, `AWS_S3_BUCKET` and `AWS_REGION`. | `compile.ts:319,801` |
| Env vars and secrets | Each variable is managed, generated (minted in the customer account), vendor, customer or optional. Required keys with no value block preflight. The relay adds DB and Redis aliases after install. | `env-classification.ts`, `apps/api/src/preflight.ts`, `packages/relay/src/binding-alias.ts` |
| Multi-workload | Web + N workers + migration + scheduled jobs, all on one image. Compose with 2 or more non-worker app services is rejected. | `rejection.ts` `checkDockerComposeMultiService` |
| Rejected | Persistent volumes / declared data dirs, k8s / Helm, Terraform, Pulumi, own CloudFormation, Serverless, Azure / GCP files, GPU, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Temporal, Redis TLS / cluster / Stack. | `rejection.ts` (20 checks) |
| Analysis limits | 200-file cap. Source is fetched only for `sh/ts/js/py/rb/go`, so Java, PHP, C#, Elixir and Rust are visible only through manifests. The AI fallback fills open questions only. | `apps/api/src/github.ts:617,647` |

Doc/code disagreements that the code check found:

- `mvp-scope.md` rejects "local disk state, Windows, ARM64, privileged". The code detects only declared volumes and data dirs. It does not detect code-level disk writes, ARM64, Windows or privileged.
- The code also rejects Temporal, `COPY .git` and any compose top-level `volumes:` block. `mvp-scope.md` does not list them.
- The web desired count is fixed at 1 in the graph. The docs say "from the profile".
- The `DatabaseState` comment in `analyser.ts` still says MySQL is unsupported.

## 3. Dataset representativeness

The canonical sample is `repo-001`..`100` (80 `improvement` + 20 `unseen`, pinned
commits, double-inspected in earlier phases). The audit kept it unchanged. The
later `unseen2` set (`repo-201`..`220`) and `repo-221` are outside this sample.

| Characteristic | Repos | Characteristic | Repos |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Node | 66 | PostgreSQL required or supported | 78 |
| Python | 18 | MySQL/MariaDB path | 11 |
| Go | 17 | SQLite default or option | 26 |
| Java/JVM | 8 | MongoDB | 2 |
| PHP | 6 | Redis required | 20 |
| Ruby / Rust / C# / Elixir | 4 / 3 / 2 / 2 | Background worker present | 55 |
| Monorepo | 52 | Migration present | 82 |
| Cohort realistic / messy / boundary | 59 / 22 / 19 | S3 used or optional | 58 |

Runtimes overlap in polyglot repositories.

Assessment: **reasonable, with a known bias.**

- The sample is open-source self-hosted software, not proprietary vendor SaaS.
- It over-represents three things relative to target vendors:
  - apps with a SQLite default and an engine selector (26),
  - self-hosted tools that keep state on local disk,
  - repositories that ship dev Compose files, Helm charts and Terraform samples.
- The first two inflate C (binding) and D (6C). The third inflates false rejections.
- Real vendors know their own env names, health route and migration command, and
  can override them. For a real vendor, many C items cost a failed first deploy,
  not a permanent block.
- 66 repositories are tagged target-MVP: a B2B web app with web + DB, optionally
  Redis, worker and S3.

## 4. Methodology

1. **Baseline.** A code-verified capability map at `51997a3e`: detectors, the 20 rejection checks, the gate, preflight, graph, planner, compiler throw paths.
2. **Pipeline run (local, no AWS, AI off).** Every repository went through the production path with the pinned snapshot:
   - `runApplicationAnalysis` → readiness report → `evaluateManifestReadiness` → production `evaluatePreflight`, run twice (no config, and all required env supplied)
   - → `manifestToApplicationGraph` → `planApplicationGraph` → `compileDeployzInfrastructure` → `buildDeploymentSpecV2`.

   The probe compiles even gate-blocked manifests. The harness is `scripts/repository-compatibility` plus a probe script. Neither is committed.
3. **Ground truth.** 8 parallel Sonnet agents (12–13 repositories each) read the source at the pinned commit. They used the benchmark notes as a starting point and verified key claims in the source.
4. **Normalization (Opus master)**, applied to all rows before totals:
   - *Friction is not a blocker.* Spurious required env or an over-provisioned resource means B with PARTIAL correctness, because the vendor is prompted and can fill or ignore it.
   - *A confident wrong fact is C.* A wrong health path, port, Dockerfile, migration command or DB/S3 env binding that fails the deploy, or silently drops to SQLite or local disk, is C.
   - *A false rejection is C.* A detector bug is never D.
   - *Vendor Dockerfile work is not 6B.* This covers no in-repo production Dockerfile, a prebuilt artifact, a build target or a `.git` copy. Category follows the rest of the architecture, flagged "vendor Dockerfile work".
   - *Size.* A larger size profile is D only with a documented memory floor. Otherwise it is recorded as uncertainty.
   - 15 rows were changed by master overrides (category or target tag).

Pipeline facts for the whole sample (v38):

- **Verdict:** READY 30 · NEEDS_ATTENTION 19 · NOT_COMPATIBLE 51.
- **Preflight with no config:** ACTION_REQUIRED 32 · ready 17 · UNSUPPORTED 51.
- **Compile:** ok 100/100.
- **Detection:**
  - Exact health-path match 30/79. Port match 76/96.
  - Redis: 22 false positives against 20 truly required.
  - PostgreSQL: 5 false positives, 7 false negatives.
  - MySQL chosen 0 times.
  - Queues 0, schedules 0.
  - 52 repositories ask for required customer keys (median 4, maximum 41).

## 6. Understanding coverage

Understanding means that Deployz describes the application correctly
(CORRECT), or rejects it for the right reason (UNSUPPORTED).

| Set | CORRECT | UNSUPPORTED | PARTIAL | INCORRECT | Understanding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All 100 | 5 | 23 | 29 | 43 | 28/100 (28%) |
| Target-MVP (66) | 2 | 8 | 18 | 38 | 10/66 (15%) |
| Non-target (34) | 3 | 15 | 11 | 5 | 18/34 (53%) |

Deployz understands what it must reject better than what it must deploy.
Most INCORRECT rows are confident wrong facts on apps that fit the MVP shape.

## 7. Deployment coverage

| Set | A | B | A+B (current) | C | D | E | A+B+C (post-C) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All 100 | 1 | 9 | **10 (10%)** | 44 | 35 | 11 | **54 (54%)** |
| In-scope (excl. E, 89) | 1 | 9 | 10 (11%) | 44 | 35 | — | 54 (61%) |

- 6 of the 10 A/B rows still carry friction: spurious required keys or unneeded RDS/Valkey.
- 3 of the 10 need vendor Dockerfile work: heroku-sample, netbox, pgweb.
- Only dashy is A with zero inputs.

## 8. Target-MVP coverage

| Target-MVP (66) | Count | Share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current (A+B) | 5 | 8% |
| Category C (MVP bugs) | 44 | 67% |
| Category D (Phase 6 / post-MVP) | 17 | 26% |
| Post-C coverage | 49 | **74%** |
| Post-C + every D capability (theoretical) | 66 | 100% |

All 44 Category C rows are target-MVP repositories. The target gap is
dominated by bugs, not by missing infrastructure.

Uncertainty:

- Post-C coverage assumes general fixes, not per-repository patches. Some C rows have a second C blocker (for example, a wrong health path plus a binding gap).
- About 10 C rows (twenty, outline, cal.diy, mattermost, windmill, teable, linkwarden, chatwoot and others) carry an unverified 512 MiB memory risk.
- Realistic post-C target coverage: **61–74% (40–49 of 66)**.

## 9. Category C bugs (MVP)

Grouped by root cause. "Primary" counts rows where the cause is the main blocker.
"Any" counts every row the cause affects.

| # | Root cause | Primary | Any | Repos (primary) | Subsystem | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | Env binding gap: the app reads its own DB/Redis/S3 names or an engine selector (`DB_CLIENT`, `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`, `*_DATABASE_*`, `SPRING_DATASOURCE_*`, `GF_DATABASE_*`, `MB_DB_*`, `BACKEND_CACHE_REDIS_URI`, `S3_ATTACHMENTS_BUCKET`). The app silently runs SQLite or local disk, or crashes. | 10 | 21 | listmonk, papermark, directus, ihatemoney, memos, docuseal, joplin, logto, casdoor, teable | planner/spec + env model | M |
| C2 | Wrong auto-detected health path: a feature route (`/csv/status`, `/v1/integrations/status`, `/upgrade_to_enterprise/status`), a missed global prefix or URI version, or another mode's route. | 9 | 12 | kutt, miniflux, ghostfolio, healthchecks, infisical, grafana, tolgee, vikunja, kratos | analysis-detector | S–M |
| C3 | False rejection: dev, optional or same-image Compose services counted as app services. | 7 | 7 | flagsmith, cal.diy, huginn, chatwoot, mattermost, windmill, BookStack | gate | M |
| C4 | False rejection: a Compose volume or Dockerfile `VOLUME` from a non-selected, dev or docs file, or one with an S3 option, read as durable local storage. | 6 | 7 | automatisch, wiki.js, CTFd, wallabag, tandoor, homarr | gate | S–M |
| C5 | Wrong Dockerfile or port: a dev/base image ranked first, a symlinked Dockerfile, or an all-in-one `EXPOSE` lost to the backend `ENV PORT`. | 5 | 5 | monica, n8n, hoppscotch, vaultwarden, wger | analysis-detector | M |
| C6 | Wrong migration command: a non-deploy script (`create`, `make`, `push`, copy step, test), a devDependency CLI missing in the runtime image, or a workspace-relative command. | 4 | 9 | unleash, zipline, rallly, docmost | analysis-detector | S |
| C7 | False rejection: a sample Helm chart or Terraform/k8s descriptor in a non-runtime directory. | 2 | 2 | nocodb, twenty | gate | S |
| C8 | Wrong or duplicate worker: a dev script (`nodemon`), or a worker the CMD already runs. | 1 | 3 | linkwarden | analysis-detector | S |

Friction issues. These are not blocking, but they hurt launch quality:

- **F1 Required-env over-claiming.** 52 repositories ask for required customer keys (median 4, maximum 41: Dockerfile `ARG`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, test vars, guarded reads). Effort: M.
- **F2 Redis over-provisioning.** 22 false positives against 20 truly required repositories, each about $12+/month. Effort: S.
- **F3 MySQL never selected.** 0 of 100, although CTFd, BookStack, monica and firefly-iii take a MySQL path. PHP and Python sources are not fetched. Effort: S–M.
- **F4 Required values missed.** Directus, outline, kratos and others need `PUBLIC_URL`-style values that Deployz does not surface. A vendor who knows the app can add them.

## 10. Phase 6 capability gaps (Category D)

| Capability | Repos | Target | Repos (target marked *) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6C EFS / persistent disk | 15 | 6 | verdaccio, mealie*, paperless-ngx, django-helpdesk*, answer*, firefly-iii, kanboard*, halo*, OrchardCore, grist-core*, gitea, karakeep, changedetection.io, nextcloud, thelounge |
| 6A/6B extra services or multiple images | 10 | 6 | ToolJet*, postiz (Temporal)*, formbricks*, typebot*, lemmy, hedgedoc*, nango*, openstatus, mastodon, penpot |
| Larger size profile (not on the 6A–6H list) | 4 | 3 | superset*, metabase*, keycloak*, Stirling-PDF |
| 6F DocumentDB (MongoDB) | 2 | 1 | LibreChat*, wekan |
| ClickHouse | 1 | 0 | plausible |
| RDS MariaDB | 1 | 0 | uptime-kuma |
| Custom PostgreSQL extension (pg_search) | 1 | 1 | lobehub* |
| Durable Redis datastore | 1 | 0 | emailengine |
| 6D Lambda, 6E DynamoDB, 6G OpenSearch (sole blocker), 6H CloudFront | 0 | 0 | none |

Category E (11): immich, homepage, authelia, coder, livebook, zulip, kafdrop,
argo-cd, microservices-demo, azure-search-openai-demo, vllm.

## 11. Capability leverage ranking

Ranked by repos unlocked ÷ effort ÷ architectural risk.

"Incremental" counts the repos where the item is the primary blocker.
The full C set is needed to reach the post-C total.

| Rank | Capability | Affected (any) | Incremental coverage | Complexity | Regression risk | MVP or Phase 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | C1 binding mechanism: vendor maps managed values to app env names; engine selector as config; block "SQLite fallback with selector unset" | 21 | +10 (+15 pt target) | M | Low (additive env) | MVP |
| 2 | C2 health-path precision: strong evidence only, prefix/version aware, else Needs input | 12 | +9 (+14 pt) | S–M | Low | MVP |
| 3 | C6 migration-command safety | 9 | +4 (+6 pt) | S | Low | MVP |
| 4 | C7 IaC/Helm sample scoping | 2 | +2 (+3 pt) | S | Low | MVP |
| 5 | C4 local-storage rejection scoping | 7 | +6 (+9 pt) | S–M | Medium (false acceptance) | MVP |
| 6 | C3 Compose service scoping (production compose only; same-image services become workers) | 7 | +7 (+11 pt) | M | Medium (false acceptance) | MVP |
| 7 | C5 Dockerfile/port selection | 5 | +5 (+8 pt) | M | Low–Medium | MVP |
| 8 | C8 worker-command hygiene | 3 | +1 | S | Low | MVP |
| 9 | Larger size profile (1 vCPU / 2 GiB) | 4 (+~10 at risk) | +4 (+5 pt) | S–M | Low–Medium (new infra version, cost) | Post-MVP |
| 10 | 6A/6B extra services + multiple images | 10 | ≤+10 (≈+5 realistic; +9 pt) | L | High (release/rollback surface) | Phase 6 |
| 11 | 6C EFS / persistent disk | 15 | ≤+15 (≈+9 realistic; +9 pt) | L | High (stateful retention, backup, purge) | Phase 6 |
| 12 | 6F DocumentDB | 2 | ≤+2 | L | High (compatibility unknown) | Phase 6 |
| 13 | ClickHouse, MariaDB, PG extensions, durable Redis | 1 each | +1 each | M–L | Medium | Post-MVP |

Leverage clusters:

- **The C1+C2 pair** affects 24 distinct rows. One of the two is the primary blocker in 19 of them.
- **Gate scoping (C3+C4+C7)** turns 15 false rejections into deployable verdicts.
- **6C has the largest Phase 6 count**, but 9 of its 15 repositories are self-hosted tools, not SaaS.
- **6A/6B ties 6C on target repositories (6).**
- **Not observed:** demand for Lambda, DynamoDB, OpenSearch, CloudFront, FIFO, and more workers per app. Queue-like work in the corpus is Redis-backed (BullMQ, Sidekiq, Celery, Oban), not SQS.

## 12. Launch-now vs Phase-6-first comparison

| Time to market | Shortest | + one L cycle | Multiple L cycles |
| Unsupported-state UX | Clear: named family + evidence today | Same | Same |
| Core value proposition | Intact: web + DB + Redis + worker + S3 is the mainstream SaaS shape | Adds breadth | Adds breadth |

The mainstream small-SaaS shape is already in the platform. Common target
apps are blocked by bugs in how Deployz reads them, not by missing
infrastructure. Phase 6 mostly adds breadth (self-hosted tools,
multi-service products).

## 13. Exact pre-launch recommendations

Do these in order. Each one is an analyser, gate or binding change with
regression tests. None adds infrastructure.

1. **C1 binding mechanism (M).**
   - Let the vendor bind any app env name to a managed value: DB URL/host/port/name/user/password, Redis URL, bucket.
   - Let the vendor set engine-selector constants (`DB_CLIENT=pg`, `DB_TYPE=postgresdb`, `MEMOS_DRIVER=postgres`) as plain config.
   - Block with a Needs-input question when the app has a SQLite/H2 fallback and its selector is unset. A silent fallback loses data.
2. **C2 health path (S–M).**
   - Auto-fill only from a Dockerfile/compose `HEALTHCHECK` or an exact health route, with the global prefix and URI version applied.
   - Never auto-fill a feature route that merely ends in `status` (COMP-039).
   - Otherwise ask.
3. **Gate scoping (C3, C4, C7; S–M).**
   - Read only the production Compose file. Ignore dev, test, docs and example files.
   - Treat same-image services as workers or optional.
   - Take `VOLUME` only from the selected Dockerfile.
   - Let S3-option evidence clear local-storage findings.
   - Report sample Helm/Terraform/k8s descriptors outside runtime paths as a warning, not a rejection.
   - Add false-acceptance regression tests for the 15 correct D/E local-disk and multi-service rejections.
4. **C6 migration command (S).**
   - Reject `create`, `make`, `push`, copy and test scripts.
   - Reject CLIs that are only devDependencies and are missing from the runtime image, and workspace-relative commands.
   - Prefer "startup" mode when the entrypoint already migrates.
5. **C5 Dockerfile and port (M).** Resolve symlinked Dockerfiles. Rank dev and base images last. Prefer an all-in-one `EXPOSE` over a backend `ENV PORT`. Take the port from the final stage.
6. **C8 worker (S).** Do not add a package.json `worker` script that is a dev script, or that the image CMD already runs.
7. **Friction (F1–F3; S–M).**
   - Do not mark Dockerfile `ARG`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, test or guarded reads as required.
   - Provision Valkey only on required evidence.
   - Detect MySQL from PHP and Python manifests and config.
8. **Re-measure.** Bump `ANALYSIS_VERSION` and rerun this 100-repo audit and `unseen2`. Then run the simulated E2E suite. Then run the version canary on 3–5 C repositories (testing strategy escalation order).

Launch gate: target-MVP A+B ≥ 60%, zero silent-SQLite outcomes, and no new
false acceptances on the D/E set.

## 14. Explicit post-launch deferrals

- **Larger size profile (first post-launch item).** It unlocks superset, metabase, keycloak and Stirling-PDF, and de-risks about 10 memory-tight C apps. It needs a new infra version and a cost review.
- **6A/6B extra services and multiple build artifacts** (formbricks, typebot, hedgedoc, nango, ToolJet, postiz).
- **6C EFS / persistent containers** (mealie, answer, kanboard, halo, grist, helpdesk). Stateful lifecycle work.
- **6F DocumentDB** (LibreChat, wekan), ClickHouse, RDS MariaDB, custom PostgreSQL extensions, durable Redis / `noeviction` (DEPLOY-037).
- **No evidence in the sample:** 6D Lambda, 6E DynamoDB, 6G OpenSearch, 6H CloudFront, FIFO queues. Defer with no date.
- **SQS and EventBridge Scheduler stay `PREVIEW`.** The sample shows no detectable demand. Do not expand them before launch.
- **Build-time features:** build targets, build args and pre-Docker build steps (twenty, n8n, keycloak, tandoor, memos). Vendors fix these in their Dockerfile.

## Uncertainty

- **Ground truth.** It is one agent pass per repository, checked against the earlier double-inspected benchmark notes. Low-confidence rows are marked in the table (`conf low`).
- **AI fallback.** It is off in local runs. Production may resolve some open questions (for example, choosing between Dockerfiles). It never overrides deterministic facts, so no C row is expected to change.
- **No real deployment.** Compile success is not runtime success, and memory fit at 512 MiB is not measured.
- **Vendor knowledge.** A vendor who knows their app can override the health path, port and migration command. For real vendors many C rows cost one failed first deploy, not a permanent block. Silent SQLite fallback (C1) stays severe.

LAUNCH MVP FIRST

- **Current practical coverage:** 10/100 (A+B). Target-MVP 5/66 (8%).
- **Target-MVP coverage after Category C:** 49/66 (74%); realistic 61–74%.
- **Post-Category-C coverage, all repositories:** 54/100, or 54/89 in scope (61%).
- **Projected coverage after the recommended pre-launch work:** the same as post-C (only C and friction work is recommended). Target 61–74%, all 54%.
- **Top 5 blockers:**
  1. Env binding gaps (21 repos)
  2. False rejections from Compose, VOLUME and IaC scoping (16)
  3. Persistent-disk need, 6C (15; 6 target)
  4. Wrong health path (12)
  5. Extra services, 6A/6B (10; 6 target)
- **Work before launch:** C1 binding mechanism; C2 health-path precision; gate scoping C3/C4/C7; C6 migration safety; C5 Dockerfile/port; C8 worker hygiene; F1–F3 friction; then rerun this audit and the canary.
- **Work deferred:** larger size profile (first), 6A/6B, 6C, 6F, ClickHouse, MariaDB, PG extensions, durable Redis, build-time features. Lambda, DynamoDB, OpenSearch and CloudFront have no evidence.
- **Strongest evidence:**
  - 44 of 66 target repositories (67%) fit the current platform and fail only on Deployz bugs.
  - The best Phase 6 capability adds 6 target repositories at L complexity.
  - All 100 graphs compile, so the infrastructure layer is not the constraint.
