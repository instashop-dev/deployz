// §40/§62 event log — the append-only audit stream.
//
// Every deployment-lifecycle transition writes one row here. Before this, the
// only writers were application deletion and the organization routes, and
// neither set deployment_id — which is the column
// GET /api/deployments/:id/events filters on, so that endpoint could never
// return anything and "Recent activity" was permanently empty.
//
// Rows are immutable: drizzle/0001_event_logs_immutable.sql installs a
// trigger that raises on UPDATE, DELETE and TRUNCATE. An event has to be
// correct when it is written; there is no patching it afterwards.
//
// Write inside the same transaction as the state change it describes, so an
// event can never disagree with the row it is about.
