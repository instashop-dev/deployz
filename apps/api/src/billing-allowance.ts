// The update runs in one transaction with the organization row locked, so
// two admin changes in flight each read the value the other left behind and
// the audit trail never records a stale "previous". The Paddle round trip is
// NOT part of the transaction (billing-reconcile.ts): the caller reconciles
// afterwards, and a provider failure never reverts what the admin decided —
// the reconciliation ledger records the drift and the safety job repairs it.
