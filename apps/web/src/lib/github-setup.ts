// The GitHub App's Setup URL lands here. GitHub sends the installing vendor
// to it right after they install (or reconfigure) the App, with
// `installation_id` in the query — but it has no idea whether they hold a
// Deployz session, so this page has to work signed out.
//
// The decision lives here rather than in the page so it can be tested without
// a Next server runtime, the same split as `host-routing.ts` and middleware.
//
// Only the API can bind an installation to an organization: the binding needs
// the vendor's session AND the App's private key. So a signed-in vendor is
// forwarded to `GET /api/github/setup`, which does the work and redirects on
// to the dashboard.
