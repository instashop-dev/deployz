/**
 * Resilience-boundary scenarios (deployment-resilience plan, Phase 16):
 * duplicate requests, transient AWS errors and a relay dying mid-DESTROY —
 * each driven through the REAL vendor API routes and the REAL relay
 * executors over the simulated account, like every other scenario spec.
 *
 * Reconciliation-watchdog behaviour (stale RUNNING jobs re-offered/parked)
 * lives in packages/cdk/test/worker.test.ts: the sweeps run in the worker
 * Lambda, which this harness deliberately does not boot — the sweep
 * functions are exercised directly there over the same PGlite migrations.
