/**
 * Relay poll loop — fetch commands from the control plane, execute them,
 * and report results back.
 *
 * The relay is egress-only: it calls OUT to the control plane; the control
 * plane never reaches INTO the customer account. Each poll cycle:
 *
 *   1. Authenticate (register on first contact, then bearer token)
 *   2. Finish and report anything an earlier cycle deferred
 *   3. Fetch pending commands for this installation
 *   4. Execute each command (with idempotency)
 *   5. Report results + observed state back to the control plane (§59)
 *
 * Step 2 exists because not every command fits in one invocation. An
 * INSTALL that is still creating its stack when the Lambda has to return is
 * reported to nobody and picked up again here on the next tick — the
 * control plane never re-offers a job it has already handed out, so the
 * relay is the only thing that can remember it.
