/**
 * INSTALL — provision the customer's application stack.
 *
 * This is the write side of what `./verify.ts` reads. The relay creates the
 * published application template as a CloudFormation stack in the customer's
 * own account, watches it to a terminal state, and reports what actually
 * happened. `verifyInstallation()` then re-asks CloudFormation the same
 * question independently, so a success claim is never taken on this module's
 * word alone.
 *
 * Three properties this module is built around:
 *
 * 1. **Stack-level tags, not template tags.** The `deployz:installation` tag
 *    goes on the `CreateStack` call itself. The relay's IAM condition
 *    (`aws:RequestTag/deployz:installation`) is evaluated against that tag,
 *    and `verifyInstallation`'s `stack-tagged` check reads it back off the
 *    stack. CDK's `Tags.of(...)` writes per-resource template tags, which
 *    neither of those two ever look at — passing only those would deny the
 *    create and then fail the verification.
 *
 * 2. **Idempotent.** A re-delivered INSTALL, a resumed one, or a retry after
 *    a lost result must never create a second stack. The stack's own
 *    existence is the record: describe first, create only when there is
 *    nothing there, and treat an `AlreadyExists` race as an in-flight create.
 *
 * 3. **Bounded, resumable waiting.** The application stack (VPC + NAT, RDS,
 *    ALB, and an ECS service CloudFormation waits to stabilise) routinely
 *    takes longer than a Lambda invocation is allowed to live. Rather than
 *    guess, this returns `in-progress` when the time budget runs out — a
 *    third answer that is neither success nor failure, so the caller can
 *    hand the same question back to the next poll instead of inventing a
 *    verdict.

 * `CreateStack` attempt, which CloudFormation itself rejects with
