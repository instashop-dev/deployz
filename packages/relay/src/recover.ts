/**
 * First-install stack recovery — the cleanup half of a retried INSTALL.
 *
 * `installApplicationStack` (./install.ts) is the honest reporter: it tells
 * the truth about the stack's real CloudFormation status and never recreates
 * a terminal-failed stack. That honesty is exactly what strands a failed
 * FIRST install: CloudFormation cannot update a `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` stack,
 * so every future INSTALL fails while it exists — and manual deletion fails
 * too, because the application stack's RDS instance is `RETAIN` +
 * `deletionProtection: true` (keeping its security group and the VPC alive)
 * and the S3 bucket is `RETAIN`.
 *
 * This module clears the retained resources that would block a
 * terminal-failed stack's deletion, then deletes the stack, so the next
 * `installApplicationStack` can create it again. It runs ONLY when the
 * command payload carries `recovery.neverInstalled: true` — set by the
 * control plane's retry-install route, which first proves no INSTALL ever
 * succeeded. Defense in depth: a stack found healthy or in progress is
 * refused untouched, whatever the payload claims.
 *
 * Orphans are cleared BEFORE the delete attempt, not after: this stack never
 * installed successfully, so its RDS/ElastiCache resources are doomed by
 * definition — there is no need to spend the wait budget watching
 * `DeleteStack` fail on a blocker its own resource list already names. A
 * clear that cannot land this pass (already deleting, from a previous poll)
 * is tolerated, not treated as failure — the retry loop's own convergence
 * proves it gone.
 *
 * Orphans are identified ONLY from the failed stack's own resource list —
 * never by name guessing — and only types whose deletion the relay's
 * tag-scoped IAM already grants (rds:ModifyDBInstance/DeleteDBInstance,
 * elasticache:DeleteCacheCluster). A retained S3 bucket is deliberately
 * left alone: it blocks nothing (it is not a VPC resource), costs nothing
 * when empty, and deleting objects would need object-level S3 permissions
 * the relay does not carry.
 *
 * Bounded by the relay Lambda's timeout: an exhausted wait budget reports
 * honestly ("still in progress") so the next retry pass continues from real
 * state. Each pass makes forward progress; none is ever destructive twice.
