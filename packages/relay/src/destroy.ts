/**
 * DESTROY executor — safely remove the application stack.
 *
 * The product boundary (Phase 6): disconnect removes the running application
 * and its networking while RETAINING the database, stored files, and
 * backups. The bootstrap relay stack is never touched. Because the
 * application template's CloudFormation retention policies govern what is
 * actually deleted versus retained, the executor's job is to delete the
 * stack and let CloudFormation enforce those policies — it enumerates and
 * deletes resources itself only for the narrow DELETE_FAILED recovery below,
 * and only the orphaned RDS/ElastiCache resources CloudFormation itself
 * named as retained.
 *
 * Safety: the stack must carry this installation's `deployz:installation`
 * tag. An untagged or mismatched stack is refused — the alternative is
 * deleting some other installation's (or some non-Deployz) stack by name.
